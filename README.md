# Forest-degradation-monitoring
Repository for technical data dealing with (semi)-evergreen forest degradation monitoring

A Google Earth Engine (GEE) script allows deriving changes in canopy cover closure, which can be interpreted as forest degradation information.


New script as Google shifted to new (Landsat) data collections and removed the old collections
- Surface Reflectance (SR) - Top of Atmosphere (ToA) Combination (SR data with 'simpleCloudScore' band coming from ToA data)

Purposes:
- Mapping all kind of canopy disturbances (natural or human induced) within (semi-)evergreen forests
- Disturbances can be interpreted as forest degradation events (after threshold -e.g. 0.05- is decided to separate signal from noise)
- In order to separate natural from human disturbances we recommend manual screening of the data by an experienced human interpreter
- Close to real time monitoring of canopy cover changes possible
